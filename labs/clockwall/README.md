Lab - ClockWall
===================

Modify the [`clock2.go`](./clock2.go) to accept a port number, and write a program `clockWall.go`, that acts as a client of several clock servers at once, reading the times from each one and displaying the results in a table, akin to the wall of clocks seen in some business offices. If you have access to geographically distributed computers, run instances remotely; otherwise run local instances on different ports with fake time zones.

On this lab, it's recommended to run your programs in 2 or more terminals; 1 for per `clock server` and 1 or more for the `clients`.

- **Terminal 1 :** Clock Server 1 - TZ=US/Easterm
```
# Clock Server initialization
$ TZ=US/Eastern    go run clock2.go -port 8010
```

- **Terminal 2 :** Clock Server 2 - TZ=Asia/Tokyo
```
# Clock Server initialization
$ TZ=Asia/Tokyo    go run clock2.go -port 8020
```

- **Terminal 3 :** Clock Server 3 - TZ=Europe/London
```
# Clock Server initialization
$ TZ=Europe/London  go run clock2.go -port 8030
```

- **Terminal 4:** ClockWall Client
```
# Starting clockWall client
$ go run clockWall.go NewYork=localhost:8010 Tokyo=localhost:8020 London=localhost:8030
US/Eastern    : 12:00:00
Asia/Tokyo    : 17:00:00
Europe/London : 02:00:00
.

```

General Requirements and Considerations
---------------------------------------
- Use the `clock2.go` and `clockWall.go` files for your implementation.
- Follow the command-line arguments convention.
- Don't forget to handle errors properly.
- Coding best practices implementation will be also considered.
