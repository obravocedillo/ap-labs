First Code Challenge
====================

This is the first challenge in your Advanced Programming Class.

1. Solve the [Length of a Nested Array](https://edabit.com/challenge/yXSTvCNen2DQHyrh6) challenge by using the programming language of your choice.
2. Below are some documentation sections that need to be updated. Those are required for the processor to build and execute your code.
3. Certainly, this problem is already solved in the web, so we recommend you to solve it by your own without consulting others solutions.
4. This is a exploratory excersice that will help the professor to adapt the labs and challenges for the course.
